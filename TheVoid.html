                    <h2>On the Subject of The Void</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">She reorganized this doc, and it's *still* a mess. *God, Luna, how haven't you been fired?*</p>
					<p><i>Note: For the clarification of ambiguity, Void refers to the being, <b>Void</b> refers to the substance, and The Void refers to the location.</i></p>
					<h3>Section 1 / Description:</h3>
					<p>Void is an approximately 6 foot tall humanoid* creature of unknown origin. </p>
					<p>Her body is made of a malleable substance she refers to as <b>Void</b>.</p>
					<p>Void can shapeshift at her own will, i.e. squishiness when she's hugged.</p>
					<p><b>Void</b> normally feels somewhat silky and soft, although Void can also control this. They can also adjust the friction of <b>Void</b>.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Section 2 / Origin:</h3>
					<p><i>Editors Note: Add Later. She won't budge about her origins.</i></p>
					<br>
					<h3>Section 3 / Abilities:</h3>
					<p>Void has complete control over all molecules in her body, allowing her to do things like floating or taking off a limb as a party trick.</p>
					<p>Adding to this, Void can clone herself, allowing for her to be in multiple places at once.</p>
					<p>With the ability to clone herself comes her pet, Abyss. Abyss is not always the same animal, having different forms, similarly to Void.</p>
					<p>Void does not need to eat, nor can she feel pain.</p>
					<p>Void is able to use a "rift" to travel between our dimension, and The Void, her homeland. The distances between the rifts in mortal space and The Void can vary, allowing for pseudo-teleportation.</p>
					<p>These rifts may be anywhere from very large to molecular size, and can vary in amount, depending on her goals.</p>
					<p>Void is also able to use these rifts to see in places that she isn't physically.</p>

				<h3>Section 4 / The Void</h3>
					<p>The Void as a place is very barron. The ground is a practically infinite mass of idle <b>Void</b>.</p>
					<p>Within the sky of The Void, there are two celestial objects, the Mind, which resembles a star, and the Eye, which is a simple red eye.</p>
					<p>The Mind controls all the molecules of Void, as well as her immense intellegence. If there is more than one Void, the Mind will siphon <b>Void</b> from the floor of The Void as needed.</B></p>
					<p>The Eye, on the other hand, is what processes Void's visual input. It is what parses between Void's sight and rift-sight.</p>
					<p><i>Editors Note: Void technically doesn't have eyes. Her 'eyes' are really just rift-sight, locked on her body.</i></p>
